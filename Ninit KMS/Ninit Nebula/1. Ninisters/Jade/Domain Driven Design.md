Q: How can we start to group together capital allocation, reputation, capital formation mechanisms?

A: Use Domain Driven Design 

1. Model System
	1. List out all objects in System (person, place, or thing)
	2. Write Stories of all users
	3. Can any be grouped with one another?
	4. Start a diagram and list all objects out


## Domain Driven Design
## Model DAOs

- Model a DAO - create a general abstraction, any object or entity fill out the description and interface 
	- User
	- Properties of a user
- Build a diagram
	- This object will have this action and interface with so and so
- Write out every object of a DAO
