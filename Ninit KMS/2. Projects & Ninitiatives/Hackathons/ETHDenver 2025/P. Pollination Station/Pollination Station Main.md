About: The pollination station is a coordination layer for DAOs and online communities and organizations to coordinate more efficiently and cross pollinate to help increase their efficiency and reach their goals by leveraging AI to generate proposals and action items to encourage cross collaboration amongst shared interests, goals, and values.

The pollinator can have in depth understanding of a DAO's infrastructure and even suggest protocol upgrades, and altering governance mechanisms to increase efficiency amongst themselves and others based on their goals and values. 

notes:

To implement the cross-pollination mechanism, we could use a graph database like Neo4j to model relationships between organizations and their goals. This would allow for efficient querying of potential collaborations.

For DAO infrastructure integration, we'd need to develop specific modules for each supported platform (e.g., Aragon, DAOstack, Colony). These modules would interface with the DAO's governance mechanisms and provide suggestions for improvements.
